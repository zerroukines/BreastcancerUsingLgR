# Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset Analysis

This project involves the analysis of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) dataset using logistic regression for tumor classification. The dataset contains various features derived from breast cancer cell nuclei and is used to predict whether tumors are malignant or benign.

## Introduction

Breast cancer is a critical health concern, and accurate classification of tumors is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. In this project, we use logistic regression to build a classification model for predicting tumor malignancy based on cell nuclei features.

## Dataset Description

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) dataset contains the following columns:

- Clump Thickness
- Uniformity of Cell Size
- Uniformity of Cell Shape
- Marginal Adhesion
- Single Epithelial Cell Size
- Bare Nuclei
- Bland Chromatin
- Normal Nucleoli
- Mitoses
- Class (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)
